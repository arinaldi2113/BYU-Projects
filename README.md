BYU-Projects
============

School projects for various classes.

BYU honor code beware! In other words if you are BYU student copy this code at your own eternal peril. And seriously, if you are trying to learn how to code copying my code will not teach you how to code. Also, its questionable whether this code will do you any good. I wrote most of this when I was a freshman. I am currently trying to refactored as much as possible to make it much more useful, but no gaurantees the code is useful in its current state.
